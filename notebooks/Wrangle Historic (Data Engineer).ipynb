was a huge sensation despite the fact that nothing beyond the first season aired on american television until later the pause was due primarily to censorship issues  cartoons were seen purely as a

and asked to soften the content of the show  but he refused to make anything but the most superficial of alterations  this was an issue even from the 1960s  goddamn has the west s perception of this

lot of  bestgreatest anime of all time  lists  cowboy bebop will surely be a regular fixture but i m not here to talk about cowboy bebop or how cool spike spiegel is or anything that can be summed up with  see you  space cowboy   i m here to talk about another anime directed by shinichiro wantanabe an anime that is one of the only two anime that i have given a 1010 on myanimelist and my favorite anime of all time i am talking about samurai champloo  what s this about  the story takes place in japan during the edo period the first episode introduces us to the three main characters  a wandering swordsman named mugen  a ronin named jin  and a waitress named fuu the setup is that mugen and jin meet at the tea house where fuu works  and they get into a fight in the process  a magistrate s son is murdered and fuu s tea house is burned to the ground  resulting in mugen and jin being sentenced to death however  the two are saved from death by fuu and episode 1 ends with the setup of the anime  fuu asks mugen and jin to accompany her to find a  samurai who smells of sunflowers   and over the course of 26 episodes  we see their journey  why should you see this  you ever hear of the saying  it s the journey  not the destination   that s one of the best ways i can describe this anime because the fun of watching this anime comes from seeing a japan that is nt like the one from history we have a version of edoera japan that has rap  graffiti taggers  and in mugen  a swordsman that is nt a swordsman that s unlike anything you ve seen before  at least i have nt   not only that  but you get to watch the development of the friendship between the three main characters on what s basically an awesome road trip  but let s talk about what s the strongest asset samurai champloo has going for it  the music this has one of the best scores i have heard in anything ever  not just in anime the soundtrack was headed by the late nujabes  who helps to bring the hip hop feel of samurai champloo to life music has always been one of the high points of any shinichiro wantanabe work  and this is no exception and just like how jazz  blues  science fiction  and film noir mesh together seamlessly in cowboy bebop  we see hip hop and samurai mesh seamlessly here  but do nt just take my word for it  here are some tracks   the opening track   battlecry  by nujabes featuring shing02   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  oobuv9q0ada   the main ending track   shiki no uta   by nujabes featuring minmi   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  mah7clumvhe   the ending track from the final episode   san francisco  by midicronica   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qghjp1qhi8g  personal note  listening to this while rewatching this solidified samurai champloo as my favorite anime of all time  where can you watch this  samurai champloo can be watched  both subbed and dubbed on hulu   http  wwwhulucomsamuraichamploo   subbed and dubbed on netflix  at the time of me writing this  febuary 16th  2016   and episodes can be bought on itunes  though i ca nt find any information regarding being subbed or dubbed on itunes   samurai champloo is my favorite anime of all time and at the very least i hope you find this to be a great anime and a great title from a great director it s very rare that i come across something that i want to see again and again without getting tired  but this is one of those things so if you want to see a great tale of swordsmen  a great tale of samurai  a great character driven journey  watch something with great music  or any combination of the aforementioned things

detachable laserhands are pretty cool  there goes the gundam s shield arm  not that the shield was ever really  useful   oooh white base is getting heavily damaged  that s how you know it s the finale  the detachable head on the zeong is a nice touch meanwhile the gundam s head gets blown off and fortunately only kills the main camera  destroyed zeong units  1  beam rifle  snake  snake    https

to be on  char s off to settle his score with kycilia after all and he s sending his sister off to amuro too  seems like he s settled on his fate  that was quite the headshot from char  zabi family    garma     dozle     degwin     gihren     kycilia   mineva   just a baby  lalah keeps doing that melting thing neat party trick  amuro s wallhacking now  i m trying to think of what other series or movie this reminds me of with one character guiding the rest to safety from afar as a final effort i m sure there s more than one there s also the weird stuff that happened at the end of battlestar galactica  maybe that s what i m thinking of maybe a video game thing  are all three of those kids newtypes  i would nt be surprised at this point if literally every named character on white base was

ending  amuro and char s duel was intense with both their mechs being destroyed kind of sad that the white base was destroyed i was not expecting char to blow off kycilia s head off this episode i was kind of expecting her to survive a little bit longer and into zeta  however i have two major issues  1  while i enjoyed the idea of newtypes and was a reason why i liked the last few episodes so much  i wish it was nt introduced so late  2  i wish the zabi family would ve been fleshed out more compared to characters like ramba ral  who were much better characterized and showed different sides  the zabi family just came across as onedimensional in fact  with an exception to mirai amp  kai  this issue extends to the white base characters as well  other than that  this was an absolutely amazing

casually abandons his favorite gundam when it becomes half useless it s just a robot afterall  i remember he operates the console to set autopilot for the last shooting  but it s not there might be movie or manga addition  amuro notices that zabi is the true enemy  but it s different from char s standpoint amuro is still talking like just a soldier hoping piece  whilst char s motivation is mostly from his personal revenge and he also now finds newtypes are more dangerous  to whom  whole humanity  or himself   so it s understandable they ca nt reconcile and join  the episode title escape is appropriate  besides amuro wanted to confront char clues in white base just fight to survive and escape from a baoa qu alive they are now federation soldier but still have civilian mindset from episode 1  overall i see the last few episodes feeling rushed  but do nt find its openendingness is unsatisfying or i say it is not an open ending  considering the scope of the story is one year war amuro survived the war along with the members of white base  char completed his revenge it is a good

that feeling when you re you re watching a seasonal anime that s somewhere between average and good  and all of a sudden the newest episode blows you away with how great it is  in the twoandahalf years i ve been watching simulcasts  i ve experienced that feeling a number of times and it s always a pleasant surprise unfortunately  not all anime are able to carry that narrative momentum through to the end  so what episodes  whether you simulcasted them or not  stand out as the gems in otherwise average  good not great  or bad shows  some that come to mind for me are  when supernatural battles become commonplace episode 7  i have a feeling this is going to be a popular answer simply due to  hatoko s amazing rant   https  vidme8yy5hatokosrantfrominoubattle   and the biggest crime in the show  is that   s  she loses her memory of it in the next episode and her concerns are brushed to the side   inoubattle is a show that s so close to being great if only it focused more on its strongest elements  danmachi episode 8   the fight   s  between bell and the minotaur was without a doubt one of the best scenes from anime in 2015 it elevated my opinion of the series from being an sao clone to a show that has genuine character development and is capable of heartpounding action   classroom crisis episode 11  classroom crisis got off to a slow start  but it picked up steam as it went culminating in this amazing episode  nagisa s   s  plan completely fails  kaito is asked to help the company build weapons  atech is on the verge of being disbanded  and nagisa is stabbed as a last second cliffhanger so much happens in this episode to move the story to its low point before the triumphant finale  but the scene that steals the show is the kiss shared by nagisa and mizuki the buildup to it is great as nagisa spills his guts to her  as is the cute and touching payoff one of the best kiss scenes i ve seen in recent memory   aldnoah zero episode 12   i remember   s  being blown away when i watched this episode for the first time the action throughout the episode was great and the genuine tension in that last scene was unbelievable the creators certainly achieved their goal of making a memorable cliffhanger too bad the second season wipes away most of the consequences from this episode   charlotte episode 7  oh charlotte it had its faults in the earlier half of the show   perhaps the most boring maedarequisite baseball episode i ve seen  but i was genuinely enjoying it too bad the last 3 episodes had to ruin all that still  charlotte did give us some great things  most notably best girl nao and episode 7   because maeda built up the relationship between   s  yu and ayumi  her death did have an impact both on the audience and on yu it was interesting watching him fall further into depression and revert into his powerabusing self from episode one and just as he s about to cross the line into drug abuse  nao finally beats some sense into him and reveals that she d been watching him the whole time that scene not only brings yu the catharsis he so desperately needs  its a big moment for nao showing how much she cares for him   this is how you do it maeda  not by expecting an emotional reaction out of the audience after a single rushed

watcher and missed yesterdays thread so i ll just write my thoughts on episodes 1 and 2  good start to the series i liked sora right off the bat with her kinda spunky attitude and sense of humor plus she s cute as life in a bunny costume which counts for something i wan na hear more about why she wants to be a star at this circus like thing and that s good her growth and determination are pretty apparent already but nothing has really set her apart from similar characters to her yet but it s episode 2 so not really complaining there  do nt have much of an opinion on the side characters yet as they have nt been shown much but i think i ll like sarah the dorm supervisor she seems funny also the cop is a huge cockblock i do nt like how almost all of the sides seem to hate her though  it seems kind of odd but understandable to a degree i just think they overdid it but fixed it pretty quick with the two girls realizing they misjudged her i m not sure how i feel about the talking statue man yet he seems out of place at the moment  animation is very good for 2003 i thought it was like a 2007 show when i first saw it it s not quite stand alone complex levels  but very good in its own right music was decent but nothing too special except for one track in episode 2 when she did the golden phoenix move  overall  i m liking it but nothing stand out

if any one from ranime has gotten in tune with their inner weeb lately  where i live we got over a foot of snow over night i thought it was amazing because i still like snow  sure driving conditions are poor and you have to shovel and plow and make room for your cars and what not  but there is something about snow that makes me feel like a young kid again  i m 25 right now   anyway  so there i am out in my yard where everything looks like a white blanket not too many foot prints  and my drive way had nt been plowed yet it is then that inspiration struck  i took out my phone and started to record i started talking about how nice the snow looked and how quiet everything was  and then when you least expected it  truth be told my acting sucks so it was probably obvious  but i digress  i yelled dynamyte    and dove into the snow ala renge from non non biyori  it felt amazing to do i then shared the video on my fb wall for other friends and family to see  but obviously almost nobody caught the weeb reference  they just thought i was being a goof  anyway tl  dr i did the renge dynamyte jump into the snow today and it made me wonder what sort of weeby things you ranime people have

lot of rambling gt   gt   gt   gt   6510   ign  this is one of my favorite series so it pains me to read that your view of the story is so skewed but i think the main takeaway here is that you did nt understand character motivations well they are very well written  but not everything is spelled out for you there is a huge amount of foreshadowing that you likely didnt catch the first time  making it seem like things came out of left field when they really didnt  gt  this show is a shippers nightmare  gt  i really wanted her stay gone or keep her amnesia just for the sake of my pairings and i think you have some bias here being angry when your ships do nt pan out is not a valid objective criticism personally i loved that you couldnt guess who would end up with who in the beginning its way more entertaining that way and i enjoy a good story with twists  gt  also theres stuff about the sea god which is sorta hard to fully explain the plot is kinda flimsy  this really was an integral part of the story and it seems like you didnt quite understand it it s a really unique and beautiful subplot that ties a lot of the events in the second half together  especially the last few episodes i ll admit i didnt really get it on the first watch but after rewatching it i was stunned at the way that it came together in the end  really though i think it comes down to whether or not you like the kind of drama that mari okada writes  like in anohana or sakurasou i really love it and i think it has an emotional element that other dramas lack  i could really gush about this series and i really think it s a

udurinthal about the light novels  there are 17 volumes in total  and the official english translation of the final volume will be released on april 19th  according to amazoncom   season 1 covers volumes 1  episodes 16  and 2  episodes 813   with the dvdonly episode  episode 7   wolf and a tail of happiness   coming from volume 7  which is a collection of short stories  the  season 2 episode 0  ova is from volume 7 as well there s also a third  longer short story in the volume about part of holo s journey before she met lawrence  that s not covered in the anime  season 2 covers volumes 3  episodes 16  and 5  episodes 712   skipping over an entertaining side journey in volume 4  in general the novels have a lot of internal dialogue from lawrence that the anime skips  though you are nt missing out on much storywise if you want to move straight to the unadapted

believe we re already here at the end of 0079  thanks to everyone who took part and kept the first wing of our project alive and healthy shoutouts to the rewatchers and the first time viewers  to the first responders and those keeping the conversation flowing well into the day  to the lurkers and the reactioners  all of you are lifeing awesome i never thought i d see a mech show or a series from the 70 s or anything with gt  1000 popularity ranking on mal on the front page  every day  for a month and a half  let alone a work that happens to be all three  but wow  it happened  and it s all because of you guys  0079 is one of my favorite anime and being able to share in the experience of enjoying it with you all has been a real pleasure  if we ever get a colony dropped on us and the world falls apart  yall would be my first picks for a white base crew lt  3   where we go from here      tomorrow  we re scheduled to watch msg iii  encounters in space unlike the other films in the saga  which i proposed as  mostly  a solid alternative to the show for those who d want it  msg iii has about 70  new footage  making it a worthwhile watch even if you ve been following the show i know their placement in the schedule seemed a bit controversial  but i ll explain why i chose to include them in that way in tomorrow s thread   following tomorrow s movie  optional   we ll have a series discussion on the  february 18th   thus concluding the first entry of the rewatch i ll have some meta questions for the rewatch there  so please swing by   we will begin watching mobile suit zeta gundam immediately afterwards  beginning on    february 19th       the reason for this change in schedule follows the results of the survey  which can be found  here   https  docsgooglecomformsd1ftvlblbmjqwo9k1ipdm648mt52fioxpve59x0js33wviewanalytics  start  publishanalytics   because we ll be watching both turn a and greco  and thunderbolt seems like it ll be ready by the

is ummmwell its pretty  i have alot of gripes with the anime honestly and i was sorta surprised at its mal score of  85 and its imbd 76 so for the sake of this post i ll say what i liked first    visuals   like i said the show is pretty the setting of both shioshishio and oshiooshi are beautiful i especially liked oshiooshi s rusted metal and rural setting the character movement is really fluid  no pun intended  and if you can get over the clannadesque character design you ll be fine    sound   the music has this mystical water theme to it its kinda hard to explain but i really liked it the ops and eds are incredible and fit the show well  i was actually planning on watching this just because of  opening 2   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  inkszyr99um    plot  without the romance    it was okay  i really liked akari and miuna s arc because of how sweet it was but  essentially the whole show is  we re gon na do an ofunehiki  which is nt bad watching the characters come together was really nice the racism between the land dwellers and sea critters was erased towards the end thankfully also theres stuff about the sea god which is sorta hard to fully explain    now thats everything objectively good about the series   this show is a shippers nightmare  so based on the first 13 episodes kaname likes chisaki who like hikari who likes manaka who tsumugu who likes  the sea    its essentially  a freakin chain hikari is so loud mouthed and verbally abusive but he has a heart of gold and can actual think deeply about himself and others manaka is a crybaby thats just as rash as hikari chisaki is super aggravating because she the classic romance character that   refuses to confess   i get that she does nt wan na change the group dynamic  but its really annoying kaname is the same way but at least he starts trying to discuss their issues once the great sleep is about to happen and he openly confessed to chisaki in front of her parents which was really badass  also everyone runs alot  you d think these chicks would join the track team considering how many times they run away crying and running are what you re gon na see alot but considering they re just 14 i guess i ll let it slide  so if you were like me  throughout the 13 eps you were shuffling how to make the pairings work in a way which everyone is satisfied then the ofunehiki happens and ruins your plans so you have to start over since manaka is pretty much shafted for half of the 2nd half and everyone grew up you re pairing was probably this miuna x hikari  kaname x sayu  and chisaki x tsumugu but nooooo manaka has to show up  i really wanted her stay gone or keep her amnesia just for the sake of my pairings and apparently so did the other characters  then there s the bs  i was gon na call them plotholes but nah so its revealed that tsumugu liked chisaki from the get go cuz of some metaphor that she s the sea or something then he says that she liked him even way back then  yeah this caught me off guard  which ca nt possibly be true  but she admits that she did    this coming from the same chick that said  she still loved hikari even after the 5 year timeskip also  manaka is revealed to have loved hikari but when kaname tried to discuss it in the classroom  she lifeing runs off saying she  does nt understand     then later on when hikari hugs her she pushes him back really hard yet  she still loved him at that time  its so contradictory  to be honest  if you re not interested in the romance then there is nt much here in terms of story and plot the romance is the essential meat of this show the way they treated miuna was awful  she tried hard but lost to plot also everyone can get ena which is nt really explained at the end but whatever  if i had to give it a rating i d give it a 6510 the characters really hurt this show and the plot is kinda flimsy its not like hanasku iroha or shirobako where the sol is where the show really shines nagi no asukara is heavily dependent on the romance which is nt that great honestly that being said  i still loved the show it was fun seeing how things would pan out    tl  dr   watch the show  its romance is stupid but its still a fun series to watch and its pretty  sorry if my writing seems

is based on a dream i had once  four nameless characters awake on a beach house in a desolate abandoned summer side town one is dressed a policeman  one is dressed as professor  one is a nurse  and the last is a hobo none of them have memories of who they were before  but follow the orders they are given in the notebooks they find next to them they each leave the town and go follow the instructions to their lives most have families or loved ones  and they continue to play the parts that have been written for them they do nt know why  but they re certain that all of this is wrong  the lives they re given are bad illusions  one policeman s son seems to be forgetting his lines  the nurse finds a camera behind a bookcase  the hobo notes that the power lines around town can not possibly work yet electricity is on  the professor finds clear inconsistencies in the lectures he s told to give but none of his students seem to notice  the town is clearly in disrepair and seems to have been abandoned for decades  but nobody seems to notice  every week they agree to come back to the house they awoke in and discuss what is going on  new notebooks appear every episode giving instructions they include character sheets with unusual stats such and jrpg spell titles all four characters begin to have uncontrollable urges  and feel as if their own minds are out of their control the ones who seem to embrace the madness gain stats and powers  the ones who refuse grow weaker and feebler  until nearly reaching death eventually they realize they must kill people in order to survive  the hobo embraces this with no problem  the professor is fascinated by the intellectual challenge  the cop and nurse find it difficult to follow the task  can they discover what is going on and survive until the end  or will they wind up killing each other and wrecking havoc on this nonsensical world they ve found themselves

manhandle him  _   hisoka does nt even give a life  i mean throwing a flying kick at a vistor is weird to begin with  but the way karate girl crawled across the flaw was right out of a horror flick  at least one childhood idol was shattered that day  on second though  life the kaleido stage  i m going home   karate girl being casually racist  dude is watching the young girl strip for the shower

idea for quite a while and i ll have to go into some plot points to make it a bit more interesting but here goes  essay incoming  mc is an immortal who has nt aged since he turned 18  he s not a vampire or god but he has a mysterious side to him because of the fact he has to remain 18 for the rest of his life he refuses to get close to anyone in his class because he knows when he graduates  he ll have to switch schools and start again it s the morning of 12th september 1995  mc has just transferred into another school in hokkaido he introduces himself to his class and sits down unlike all the other times however  for some reason mc is tense and uneasy and can not stop sweating he dwells on it when he goes home to bed  he lives on his own as his parents died of oldage a long time ago he has no family left in the world that he is aware of he does nt want a family nor does he care about family he wakes up the next morning  he goes about his daily routine and checks his watch  he s 20 minutes late for school and again he feels tense and ca nt stop sweating  he falls to the floor trying to catch his breath and when he calms down he heads out the door to catch the next train as he s wandering the streets he realizes something is not right he walks past an electronic store where catches the local news being played on a tv  it turns out that during the night  the majority of his village was massacred by a single unknown person mc shrugs it off as he s seen this type of event far too often for it to have an effect on him he shows up at school but alas  a huge number of students were involved in the massacre and the school suspends all activity  as mc is heading out the door to return home he is confronted by a male about the same age as him physically who has a striking resemblance to mc s uncle who should have died 200 years ago with the rest of his family unclelooking character introduces himself as mc s uncle and claims the massacre was mc s fault for not doing his job in the first place at this point mc is completely dumbfounded and a fight ensues between mc and mc s uncle with mc s uncle completely dominating the fight mc returns to his birth place wounded and seeks answers immediately  he enters his father s study that is filled to the brim with books and documents pertaining to mc s  disorder   after many days and nights of researching  mc discovers he and his uncle are the results of thousands of years worth of genetic manipulation and were brought into the world for one purpose  to lay waste to human civilization so that another race can inherit the earth from humans mc disappears completely for 15 years while his uncle roams japan  destroying anything and everything in his path mc returns but to the uncle s suprise  mc has started to age slightly and now resembles mc s father and carries with him a sword not from this world the 2 are pitted against each other as eternal rivals  one is trying to protect the place where his mother and father enjoyed their lives  fell in love and gave birth to him the other is trying to destroy every last trace of humanity that s pretty much where i stand atm  i have a host of new characters that will be introduced i m writing this as a novel  slightly longer than a light novel not as big as a fullon novel basically it s my dream anime and i m just adding stuff as it comes  i do nt have an ending in mind and there s definitely going to be romance since i m a massive fan of romance anime i m currently up to chapter 4 or so where mc has followed his uncle to a school in shinjuku  mc now has an ally  a young man named mitsuo oh and mc s name is nobu  uncle s name is

the unusual contradictions we re getting with grimgar is because of the production studio  a1 pictures they mass produce shows  they pumped out 12 shows in 2015  10 in 2014   they re throwing a bunch of ideas at the wall and seeing if a few will stick on paper  grimgar wo nt stick it sounds boring but this time they picked a great director but little budget but the execution is great but it s sooooo slow paced that s because a1 only gave the director little material  i m really liking grimgar it s alluring plot is nt everything the world they ve built up and the characters are good enough it s slow but that s what defines

sign of nakamura s talent that my mind did nt really grab on to how many pan shots there were in that episode until you pointed it out that goes to show how he intersperses the pan shots throughout the episode so they do nt stand out rather  they flow naturally with the deliberately paced direction of the series  my favorite one was definitely the threepeat tilt up with yume and haruhiro against the wall the way we progressively get closer to haruhiro s face emphasizes the increasing emotion of what he s saying and you can tell they are nt zooming into the same shot 3 times  decreasing the image quality as they get closer like some anime do the third tilt is clearly a new drawing with a different expression on his

scene with kujo holding for dear life onto victorique s ring hits me so hard followed with victorique holding onto kujo s pendant i had to stop and take a breath  i thought the transition from victorique s black dress from the first half of the show to the brightly colored ones from the second half were neat at first because i thought it was a  summer is too hot to wear black  kind of thing  but she kept wearing new different colored clothing into winter and so on this episode though makes it clear through the contrast between the two charming monster costumes that the change in clothing was actually symbolic for the change in victorique after she spent a lot of time with kujo i love that  now holy life i did  not  remember that  spectacular albert de blois vs cordelia fight scene

episode of jojo _the ride never ends_ this old lady looks creepy  holy shit  looks like dio also has a harem and he just killed a hot 2d grill what a waste  the fear of seeing dio fills you up with joy sure  ofc the op starts right after a shocking moment like that  ok  so i swear i ve heard this ding sound effect before  and i m pretty sure it s just a common one anyone can use  since i remember it specifically from xcom 2  oh god  that bug has a mouth inside a mouth like it s straight out of alien or something  this tower of gray guy sounds like a terrible person ruining the lives of so many with these  accidents   more ora ora ora ora oras     oh god  why  that was brutal  feels weird to remember that this is a japanese series  so they need to explain english words to the audience just in case they do nt know it but this begs the question why the bug wrote in english  lel  what an old geezer also  i call bullshit on that chop no way you can make a guy unconscious like that  looks like kakyoin wants to take all the glory for himself this episode  nvm lel looks like he got rekt  oh shit  never mind looks like tower got rekt instead he was rused  rip bug and evil old man the world is a better place without them  i can handle most of jojo s bizarre bullshit  but them being able to woo women instantly is pretty unrealistic tbh how are they able to do that  yet speedwagon ca nt  how can he talk without a tongue  i like how joseph is shocked to hear he will be landing the plane i mean  we all remember how good he is with planes from that last part  tbh jotaro  it never is joseph s fault that the plane is crashing  hot cola sounds super disgusting tbh how do you even come up with such a weird combination  i m liking joseph more and more he stands up to this food injustice his american ways have moved my heart   same  same tbh jotaro  how is kakyoin so well versed in the world and its mannerisms  oh look  it s one of the guys in the op lem me guess  he is also gon na be an enemy to jojo s crew  and then become an ally  that food looks disgusting oh god  china seems to be a terrible place for the visual nature of cuisine  _menacing_ a clock made out of fire  but what moves the hands  jojo pls  this bullshit is too hard to swallow  that screenshot of the day made me realize how wiggly kakyoin s hair looks

affected by temara s detention  and fee knows yuri well enough to comment on the change she s noticed  albeit offscreen   little things which sound simple to pull off  but they re even easier to cut

god eater  the description from myanimelist   set in a postapocalyptic japan in the year 2071 the world has been mostly destroyed by mysterious monsters known as the aragami an organization known as fenrir was made to exterminate aragami using god arcs   weapons made from aragami cells those who specialize in exterminating aragami are known as god eaters their god arcs originally could only keep a single form  however a new type has been discovered that can switch between gun and blade form since then  they have been classified newtypes and the previous as oldtypes  oh wow  special monsters that can only be killed by special young adults with special powers now i m sure with enough generalization you boil any anime down to a vague and unoriginal sentence  so what i m asking is for anime that you really enjoyed despite you personally looking at the description and thinking  there is so much originality here it must have been written by someone who s lost their hopes  dreams

definitely think panning shots and in general  direction that involves the camera moving more often than not is a trait of western television as you said in the essay  there can be many uses for this technique to draw attention to fanservice  give multiple views of how characters feel in one moment and the most utilised one in my opinionto keep the audience s attention now when i say it like that  it does sound rather negative and to a degree it is this form of direction displays how the average person these days ca nt stay focused on television series  that being said  i do in fact like this technique still it has the ability to liven up scenes that would otherwise be dull and uninteresting with no movement keeping the viewer engaged is important and even though i do nt like how our attention spans seem to be decreasing  this is a good way to keep the audience s attention where it should be grimgars director is doing a splendid job in this regard especially considering how slow

what i mean is if i watch an anime where i try out both sub and dub first and enjoy them equally  i would alternate them every second episode so for example  episode 1 i watch it in sub  then watch it in dub in episode 2 and then back to sub for episode 3 and so on this was the case for me with fullmetal alchemist  brotherhood since i thought both versions were excellent  so what are the benefits and downsides to this  well you get to appreciate experiences of both versions and you get the best of both worlds when a particular character voice you like exists in a specific version same goes for narrative scenes where one of them might be better in a another language the downsides could be that it might hurt your immersion with the anime series  it does nt affect me honestly  when listening to a specific language also you might miss some details or moments in a certain episode that you did nt watch  through that version  when alternating  so has anyone of you tried doing this especially

expression misaki showed in the second half of the episode put me on edge there s everything in there  jealousy  at asuka   anger  at shindou for not taking misaki seriously   selfdoubt  misaki does nt think she s good enough despite scoring against shindou   while everyone else celebrates asuka s achievements  misaki is the one who does not step forward  despite being the person who gets asuka to relax in the locker room just before the match  this episode does highlight something else too  asuka s ability to perform well has more to do with the fact that she has little to no prior experience of fc and thus is nt bounded by traditional ways of approaching it  it takes a great amount of mutual trust to convince someone to close their eyes and listen to instructions the way that masaya and misaki did i suspect masaya has been in a similar situation before  i m excited for the next two to three episodes to see how all of this plays out i wonder if there will be enough time to deal with the fallout of this episode and set up for a somewhat satisfying conclusion given that we re already halfway into the

think panning shots and in general  direction that involves the camera moving more often than not is a trait of western television as you said in the essay  there can be many uses for this technique to draw attention to fanservice  give multiple views of how characters feel in one moment and the most utilised one in my opinionto keep the audience s attention now when i say it like that  it does sound rather negative and to a degree it is this form of direction displays how the average person these days ca nt stay focused on television series  that being said  i do in fact like this technique still it has the ability to liven up scenes that would otherwise be dull and uninteresting with no movement keeping the viewer engaged is important and even though i do nt like how our attention spans seem to be decreasing  this is a good way to keep the audience s attention where it should be grimgars director is doing a splendid job in this regard especially considering how slow paced the series is</td><td>d01wfz9</td><td>anime</td><td>entertainment</td><td>1.45563328E9</td><td>cycle112</td><td>11.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>866.0</td><td>7845.0</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>i have absolutely zero

the unusual contradictions we re getting with grimgar is because of the production studio  a1 pictures they mass produce shows  they pumped out 12 shows in 2015  10 in 2014   they re throwing a bunch of ideas at the wall and seeing if a few will stick on paper  grimgar wo nt stick it sounds boring but this time they picked a great director but little budget but the execution is great but it s sooooo slow paced that s because a1 only gave the director little material  i m really liking grimgar it s alluring plot is nt everything the world they ve built up and the characters are good enough

sign of nakamura s talent that my mind did nt really grab on to how many pan shots there were in that episode until you pointed it out that goes to show how he intersperses the pan shots throughout the episode so they do nt stand out rather  they flow naturally with the deliberately paced direction of the series  my favorite one was definitely the threepeat tilt up with yume and haruhiro against the wall the way we progressively get closer to haruhiro s face emphasizes the increasing emotion of what he s saying and you can tell they are nt zooming into the same shot 3 times  decreasing the image quality as they get closer like some anime do the third tilt is clearly a new drawing with a different expression on his

i look forward to seeing more of her  and to seeing the whys of her actions  kalos is great  and his interactions with sora have been very funny  i do nt think he s a perv i hope he seems to have big hopes and exceptions for sora  he clearly sees something others do nt good guy kalos  i love   dio   fool  the spirit of the stage  i really was nt expecting this kind of twist  but i really do enjoy and appreciate the little supernatural twists in otherwise normal circumstances ala dera in tamako market it just adds some spice  sora s hard work and guts are making this a great watch so far i m really enjoying the comedy the exaggerated iconography in anime has nt grown old for me yet  which kaleido stage does very well  and interactions between sora and fool have been hilarious to watch i look forward to more what i m most hopeful for and looking forward to is seeing strong bonds of family and friendship form between the cast as we go on  the animation feels very similar to both gintama and cardcaptor sakura in many ways  and looking at anime news network there seems to be a number common key animators  but it only credits them for certain episodes i think the similarities are pretty uncanny though any one else think this  or can confirm or deny any common key factors  thanks again pittman  for

really shows what i love about this anime there really aren  t any deus ex machina  everything the characters achieve is built on their own power and determination through all the  struggle   http  iimgurcomya5xe1gjpg   sora is able to claw her way  in   http  iimgurcom3ujisn6jpg   i really like the way  fool   http  iimgurcomtdxmlspjpg   put   http  iimgurcomjri0wv4jpg   it   http  iimgurcomyu71wxzjpg   reminds me of  clannad   http  iimgurcomdw0klsigifv    for anyone thinking fool will just magically make sora a superstar  it  s just not true it  s all on sora herself   also  i think this episode did a decent job in conveying the  cutthroat   http  iimgurcomzdoyzvkjpg  nature of being in an avantgarde circus while i don  t agree with the actions of the others  i try to think about it in their shoes these people have dedicated their entire lives to having a   chance   at getting a role  i really love this  documentary   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  blouxprahtq   45 minutes  about it   all of a sudden  some random girl blows past the whole process and performs on stage while there were some major misunderstandings  i can imagine how frustrating that can feel once sora shows her true dedication  there  s a  change   http  iimgurcomizsnmuojpg  in heart i think that throughout kaleido star  characters that seem evil at first are also just trying their best and despite initial conflicts  they are reasonable  and they are willing to understand once sora proves herself the characters are all  real  people  not including fool</td><td>d02flgf</td><td>anime</td><td>entertainment</td><td>1.45566029E9</td><td>lijda</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>5.0</td><td>104.0</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>first time watcher and missed yesterdays thread so i ll just write my thoughts on episodes 1 and 2  good start to the series i liked sora right off the bat with her kinda spunky attitude and sense of humor plus she s cute as life in a bunny costume which counts for something i wan na hear more about why she wants to be a star at this circus like thing and that s good her growth and determination are pretty apparent already but nothing has really set her apart from similar characters to her yet but it s episode 2 so not really complaining there  do nt have much of an opinion on the side characters yet as they have nt been shown much but i think i ll like sarah the dorm supervisor she seems funny also the cop is a huge cockblock i do nt like how almost all of the sides seem to hate her though  it seems kind of odd but understandable to a degree i just think they overdid it but fixed it pretty quick with the two girls realizing they misjudged her i m not sure how i feel about the talking statue man yet he seems out of place at the moment  animation is very good for 2003 i thought it was like a 2007 show when i first saw it it s not quite stand alone complex levels  but very good in its own right music was decent but nothing too special except for one track in episode 2 when she did the golden phoenix move  overall  i m liking it but nothing stand out yet</td><td>d02j182</td><td>anime</td><td>entertainment</td><td>1.45566541E9</td><td>mmreviews</td><td>2.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>44.0</td><td>4639.0</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>welcome to the

must have been a production office suggestion box of ways to keep tanabe and hachi apart  and it was all but lampshaded here  still  now that they ve taken one step forward  i wonder how long until hachi s sensei kicks the bucket  to mix metaphors   especially considering this is a limited ensemble effort  one thing i think planetes does well is character continuity for example  clare remains affected by temara s detention  and fee knows yuri well enough to comment on the change she s noticed  albeit offscreen   little things which sound simple to pull off  but they re even easier to cut for time  or to simplify down to an implication rather than a whole scene incidentally  i d say there are 5 starring  characters at this point  hachi  tanabe  yuri  claire and fee   but i would nt be

joy sure  ofc the op starts right after a shocking moment like that  ok  so i swear i ve heard this ding sound effect before  and i m pretty sure it s just a common one anyone can use  since i remember it specifically from xcom 2  oh god  that bug has a mouth inside a mouth like it s straight out of alien or something  this tower of gray guy sounds like a terrible person ruining the lives of so many with these  accidents   more ora ora ora ora oras     oh god  why  that was brutal  feels weird to remember that this is a japanese series  so they need to explain english words to the audience just in case they do nt know it but this begs the question why the bug wrote in english  lel  what an old geezer also  i call bullshit on that chop no way you can make a guy unconscious like that  looks like kakyoin wants to take all the glory for himself this episode  nvm lel looks like he got rekt  oh shit  never mind looks like tower got rekt instead he was rused  rip bug and evil old man the world is a better place without them  i can handle most of jojo s bizarre bullshit  but them being able to woo women instantly is pretty unrealistic tbh how are they able to do that  yet speedwagon ca nt  how can he talk without a tongue  i like how joseph is shocked to hear he will be landing the plane i mean  we all remember how good he is with planes from that last part  tbh jotaro  it never is joseph s fault that the plane is crashing  hot cola sounds super disgusting tbh how do you even come up with such a weird combination  i m liking joseph more and more he stands up to this food injustice his american ways have moved my heart   same  same tbh jotaro  how is kakyoin so well versed in the world and its mannerisms  oh look  it s one of the guys in the op lem me guess  he is also gon na be an enemy to jojo s crew  and then become an ally  that food looks disgusting oh god  china seems to be a terrible place for the visual nature of cuisine  _menacing_ a clock made out of

and asked to soften the content of the show  but he refused to make anything but the most superficial of alterations  this was an issue even from the 1960s  goddamn has the west s perception of this

lot of  bestgreatest anime of all time  lists  cowboy bebop will surely be a regular fixture but i m not here to talk about cowboy bebop or how cool spike spiegel is or anything that can be summed up with  see you  space cowboy   i m here to talk about another anime directed by shinichiro wantanabe an anime that is one of the only two anime that i have given a 1010 on myanimelist and my favorite anime of all time i am talking about samurai champloo  what s this about  the story takes place in japan during the edo period the first episode introduces us to the three main characters  a wandering swordsman named mugen  a ronin named jin  and a waitress named fuu the setup is that mugen and jin meet at the tea house where fuu works  and they get into a fight in the process  a magistrate s son is murdered and fuu s tea house is burned to the ground  resulting in mugen and jin being sentenced to death however  the two are saved from death by fuu and episode 1 ends with the setup of the anime  fuu asks mugen and jin to accompany her to find a  samurai who smells of sunflowers   and over the course of 26 episodes  we see their journey  why should you see this  you ever hear of the saying  it s the journey  not the destination   that s one of the best ways i can describe this anime because the fun of watching this anime comes from seeing a japan that is nt like the one from history we have a version of edoera japan that has rap  graffiti taggers  and in mugen  a swordsman that is nt a swordsman that s unlike anything you ve seen before  at least i have nt   not only that  but you get to watch the development of the friendship between the three main characters on what s basically an awesome road trip  but let s talk about what s the strongest asset samurai champloo has going for it  the music this has one of the best scores i have heard in anything ever  not just in anime the soundtrack was headed by the late nujabes  who helps to bring the hip hop feel of samurai champloo to life music has always been one of the high points of any shinichiro wantanabe work  and this is no exception and just like how jazz  blues  science fiction  and film noir mesh together seamlessly in cowboy bebop  we see hip hop and samurai mesh seamlessly here  but do nt just take my word for it  here are some tracks   the opening track   battlecry  by nujabes featuring shing02   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  oobuv9q0ada   the main ending track   shiki no uta   by nujabes featuring minmi   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  mah7clumvhe   the ending track from the final episode   san francisco  by midicronica   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qghjp1qhi8g  personal note  listening to this while rewatching this solidified samurai champloo as my favorite anime of all time  where can you watch this  samurai champloo can be watched  both subbed and dubbed on hulu   http  wwwhulucomsamuraichamploo   subbed and dubbed on netflix  at the time of me writing this  febuary 16th  2016   and episodes can be bought on itunes  though i ca nt find any information regarding being subbed or dubbed on itunes   samurai champloo is my favorite anime of all time and at the very least i hope you find this to be a great anime and a great title from a great director it s very rare that i come across something that i want to see again and again without getting tired  but this is one of those things so if you want to see a great tale of swordsmen  a great tale of samurai  a great character driven journey  watch something with great music  or any combination of the aforementioned things

to be on  char s off to settle his score with kycilia after all and he s sending his sister off to amuro too  seems like he s settled on his fate  that was quite the headshot from char  zabi family

kind of expecting her to survive a little bit longer and into zeta  however i have two major issues  1  while i enjoyed the idea of newtypes and was a reason why i liked the last few episodes so much  i wish it was nt introduced so late  2  i wish the zabi family would ve been fleshed out more compared to characters like ramba ral  who were much better characterized and showed different sides  the zabi family just came across as onedimensional in fact  with an exception to mirai amp  kai  this issue extends to the white base characters as well  other than that  this was an absolutely amazing

casually abandons his favorite gundam when it becomes half useless it s just a robot afterall  i remember he operates the console to set autopilot for the last shooting  but it s not there might be movie or manga addition  amuro notices that zabi is the true enemy  but it s different from char s standpoint amuro is still talking like just a soldier hoping piece  whilst char s motivation is mostly from his personal revenge and he also now finds newtypes are more dangerous  to whom  whole humanity  or himself   so it s understandable they ca nt reconcile and join  the episode title escape is appropriate  besides amuro wanted to confront char clues in white base just fight to survive and escape from a baoa qu alive they are now federation soldier but still have civilian mindset from episode 1  overall i see the last few episodes feeling rushed  but do nt find its openendingness is unsatisfying or i say it is not an open ending  considering the scope of the story is one year war amuro survived the war along with the members of white base  char completed his revenge it is a good
